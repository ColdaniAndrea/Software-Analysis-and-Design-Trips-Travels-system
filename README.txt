This is a university project where my team had to create a software for Trips and Travels where are stored different catalogues belonging each to different agencies.
After that they asked us to extend our project with new features: this second part was made in 48h.

1° PART (V1 files):
In short words: all operations done by customers (booking, ecc...) are managed by Amministrator and Operator. The Amministrator can delete, add or modify travel packages from catalogues and the Operator manage customers requests (booking, modifying booking, ecc...).

2° PART (V2 files):
Main new features were to add thath customers can be "loyal" or "loyal plus": so they can have a loyalty card and have some more discounts. Furthermore we had to gave the possibility for customers to book directly without involving the Operator.
